###ABOUT THE FESTIVAL
The Radahn Festival is another way of playing Elden Ring with friends. It's a race against time and others players. For each game, you'll need a Host and a bunch of players. You can of course play it all by yourself (as I do to test each festival), it's your game! The ideas is similar to Elden Ring Bingo, players got time to fulfill objectives. Objectives gives points. At the end of the timer, Players stop and you can start to count the points. 

###RULES
1. Every players create a new Wretch characters with no items and go the the Church of Elleh (where Kalé the merchant is) without getting any site of grace, nor taking materials on the way.
2. The Host will tell the players the MANDATORY and PROHIBITED items they need during the race.
3. AFter every players got the mandatory items, the host will give them 5 MINUTES to build their dream characters. They can get every items Kalé sell with the exception of PROHIBITED items.
4. When the 5 minutes timer is done, it's prohibited to use Kalé's extended shop again during the rest of the game.
5. The Run start.
6. Every 5 minutes during 60 minutes (12 objectives), the host will gives objectives with hints to the players. In my case, I send objectives as a message on a Discord channel.
7. Players can achieves those objectives in any way they want.
8. At the end of the first 60 minutes, the players got another 60 minutes to finish a maximum of objectives.

###MANDATORY AND PROHIBITED ITEMS
1. Mandatory items are necessary to complete some objectives and are too difficult/long to get in the run. So they're given to the players before the start.
       Ex. : The Pureblood Knight Medal is a reward during White Mask Varé's questline, it's way too long to get it but a mandatory item to complete the seventh objective of Radahn Festival 1
2. Prohibited items are items that player cannot freely get in Kalé's extended shop because it's too helpful and can broke the game.
       Ex. : Shabriri Howl is a prohibited item in Radahn Festival 1 because one of the bonus objectives is to get Shabriri Howl.
