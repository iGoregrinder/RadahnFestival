### ABOUT THE FESTIVAL
The Radahn Festival is another _way_ of playing Elden Ring with your friends. It's a race against time and others players. For each game, you'll need a host and a bunch of players. You can of course play it all by yourself (as I do to test each festival), it's your game! The principle is similar to Elden Ring Bingo: Players achives objectives. Objectives gives points. The player who scored the most of points win. 

### RULES
1. Every players create a new **Wretch** character with **no** keepsakes. Go the the **Church of Elleh** (where Kalé/Glorious Merchant is) without getting any site of grace, nor taking materials on the way.
2. The Host will tell the players the [mandatory and prohibited items](#mandatory-and-prohibited-items) they need during the race.
3. AFter every players got all the **mandatory** items, the host will give them **5 minutes** to build their dream characters. They can get every items Kalé sell with the exception of **prohibited** items.
4. When the **5 minutes** timer is done, players can't use Kalé's extended shop again during the rest of the game. 
5. _The Run start_
6. The host will gives a new objectives (with/without hints) to the players every 5 minutes for the first 60 minutes (12 objectives in total). In my case, I send objectives as a message on a dedicated Discord channel.
7. Players can achieves those objectives in any order and without any restriction.
8. At the end of the first 60 minutes, the players got another 60 minutes to finish a maximum of objectives (total duration is 120 minutes).
9. The race end when the timer is over (120 minutes). The host then proceed to count points.

### MANDATORY AND PROHIBITED ITEMS
1. Mandatory items are necessary to complete some objectives and are too difficult/long to get during the run. So they're given to the players before the start.
>_(Ex. : The Pureblood Knight Medal is a reward during White Mask Varé's questline, it's way too long to get it but a mandatory item to complete the seventh objective of Radahn Festival 1)_
2. Prohibited items are items that player cannot freely get in Kalé's extended shop because it's too helpful and can broke the game.
>_(Ex. : Shabriri Howl is a prohibited item in Radahn Festival 1 because one of the bonus objectives is to get Shabriri Howl.)_

### Objectives
The "Festivals" I made are available on my Instagram (https://linktr.ee/Goregrinder). I test them to make sure all objectives can be completed on time. If you create your own Festival, be sure to share it to me ! I'm always interested :-)
